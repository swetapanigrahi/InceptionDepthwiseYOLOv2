# InceptionDepthwiseYOLOv2

Pedestrian Detection Code using InceptionDepthwiseYOLOv2

1. The Data_Creation folder contains code to extract data table from INRIA, Caltech and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets.

2. The Benchmark Algorithms contains code for existing methods such as FasterRCNN, YOLOv2, YOLOv3 and SSD. The training hyperparameters in these codes can be varied.

3. The InceptionDepthwiseYOLOv2 contains code for the proposed YOLOv2 network for pedestrian detection. The training hyperparameters can be varied.  


The datasets can be downloaded from:
